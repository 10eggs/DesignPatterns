    //Motivation
    //Objects use other objects fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition
    //Composition lets us make compound objects
    //Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly
    //Object of type Foo and Collection<Foo> they have certain common api without knowing if you work on single element or on elements collection
    //Basically it is a mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner
