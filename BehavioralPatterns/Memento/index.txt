Motivation:

Object or systems go through the changes (i.e. bank acc gets deposits and withdrawals)
There are many ways how we can handle these changes
One way is to record every change (Command) and teach
a command ('undo') itself

Another is to simple save snapshots of the system

A token/handle representing the system state.
Lets us roll back to the state when the token was generated.
May or may not directly expose state information
